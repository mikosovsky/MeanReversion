    "If a price closes closer to the daily low than to the daily high, its IBS value will be less than 0.5, with a value of 0 indicating that the price closed at the day's lowest point. For today's analysis, we can regard any IBS value under 0.6 as signaling potential bearish sentiment. Within the framework of mean reversion for stable asstes like the S&P 500, this suggests the price may likely rise again soon."
